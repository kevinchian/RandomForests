To run the code first enter the spam-dataset folder and run python featurizer.py. I used a bag of words model so the features will be different.Then, to run decision trees/random forests, type python dtree.py.

The features_keys.txt code is just the corresponding labels to the feature numbers when I ran my code for the writeup. It can be remade by running featurizer.py with everything below pprint commented out and piping out the output to a text file. 

A lot of the code is commented out in dtree.py. To get a path for decision tree classification uncomment the indicated print statement. Same goes for the random forest root splits that the writeup requires.
